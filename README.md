Shopify Sales & Customer Funnel Dashboard
I have developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive analysis of Shopify sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. This report helps stakeholders understand key business metrics and make data-driven decisions effectively.
Dashboard Overview
The Shopify Sales & Customer Funnel Dashboard visualizes critical KPIs including:

Net Sales: $4.18 million

Total Quantity Sold: 7,534 units

Average Order Value: $562.6

Total Customers: 4,431

Repeat Customers: 2,039 (46% repeat rate)

These insights help analyze the effectiveness of customer acquisition and retention, as well as the overall revenue flow.

 Regional Performance
The dashboard displays Net Sales by Province and City, enabling localized performance evaluation. Cities such as New York City, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Houston showed high sales activity, guiding regional marketing and inventory strategies.
 Time-Based Sales Trends
It includes detailed sales trends by day and hour, allowing businesses to identify peak shopping hours and high-performing sales days. This insight supports better campaign planning and staffing decisions.
Payment Gateway Insights
Different payment methods are broken down in terms of total sales. Shopify Payments leads with the majority share (~58%), followed by PayPal, Amazon Payments, and Gift Cards. Understanding gateway performance helps assess customer preferences and optimize checkout experiences.
Product Category Analysis
The dashboard showcases sales by product type, with Running Shoes, Tennis Shoes, and Walking Shoes emerging as the top sellers. Less popular items like Accessories or Water Shoes are also tracked, enabling informed product planning and stocking.

Customer Behavior & Funnel Metrics
Key behavioral metrics include:

Repeat Rate: 46%

Purchase Frequency: 1.68

Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): $943.6

Single vs Repeat Customers: 2,392 vs 2,039

These help evaluate customer retention and the impact of loyalty strategies.

Drillthrough Feature
This report also includes an interactive Drillthrough page for deep-dive analysis. By right-clicking on a specific city, province, or product category, users can navigate to a detailed report view showing all relevant transactions filtered by the selected field. This improves data exploration, traceability, and actionability for decision-makers.
